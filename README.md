# bspwm-unified-workspace
Configuration files for a traditional unified workspace in bspwm. Uses polybar.

## Inspired by the tiling scripts krohnkite/bismuth in KDE
I essenially wanted most of the same functionality as krohnkite/bismuth, but in an actual standalone WM.
After trying i3-gaps, i was very disappointed. 

i3 and many other window managers do not offer the traditional Desktop Environment's way of handling workspaces/desktops.
Instead of having a unified workspace, each monitor has it's own workspaces.

bspwm-unified-workspace goal is to have configs for "one workspace across all monitors". You can have more than one, or four, workspaces that are shared on all monitors.
